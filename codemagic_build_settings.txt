Codemagic Build Settings (Current Status)

Mode: Debug (NEEDS TO BE CHANGED TO RELEASE!)

Build Arguments:
- Android: --debug (with flavor: --flavor android-production -t lib/main_prod.dart)
- iOS: --debug (with flavor: --flavor ios-production -t lib/main_prod.dart)
- Web: --release

Problem: iOS build is in Debug mode, which causes crashes on TestFlight.

Solution: Change Mode from "Debug" to "Release"

Steps:
1. Click on "Release" radio button in the "Mode" section
2. Save settings
3. Start new build
